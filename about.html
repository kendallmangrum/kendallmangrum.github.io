            <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1>
            <p class="para">Hello there! My name is Kendall Mangrum and I'm from the 
                small town of Shelbyville, Indiana which is located about 30 mintues to the
                southeast of Indianapolis. I have lived in Shelby County my entire life, besides when in Bloomington for college, so I am very used to 
                living out in the country and being surrounded by fields of corn and soybeans. 
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                I graduated from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington in the spring of 2021 
                with a B.S. in Informatics with minors with Computer Science and Public Health. While at IU, I was a member of the inaugural Luddy Living Learning Community, 
                a member of the Hutton Honors College, and an Undergraduate Instructor for an introduction to computers and computing course. 
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                I have had a wide array of interests and hobbies over the years. When I find some free time, I enjoy reading, biking, hiking, playing video games, hanging out with friends,
                and being with family. Usually some of these things overlap, as I prefer to do things with friends and family rather than by myself. One of my favorite things to do is
                to just sit around a fire talking the night away with friends. 
            </p>

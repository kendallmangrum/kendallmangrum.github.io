Man, 2022 was quite the year. For me, the year could probably be broken up into three parts: January-early July, the end of July-the first week of November, and then The second week of November until the end of the year. If I had to describe the three parts, the first block of time I would consider pretty boring and uneventful. The time spanning from July to the beginning of November would be like getting surprised with an all inclusive vacation. It was full of new experiences, fun, love, and making memories. The final part of the year could be described as getting sucker punched in the gut by Muhammad Ali. It was completely unexpected, and not in a good way. With that said, here are some of the things that this past year either taught me for the first time or maybe reminded me about:

- Don't be afraid to take chances in life or try new things. This year I was offered to teach math at my former high school and was unsure whether I should take the opportunity or not because I was comfortable at my job at the time and my degree is in Informatics. I did decide to take the job and I'm glad I did!

- Enjoy the little things in life. Take the time to look around yourself, especially outside. Look at the flowers, the trees, clouds, wild animals, rocks.

- You never know how long something is going to last, so slow down, take it all in, and enjoy it while you can. 

- You can be doing nothing with a certain person and that nothing is everything to you. Just being there, in their presence, in that moment, is perfect.

- Giving to others truly is better than receiving.

- Just because things are tough now doesn't mean that they will stay that way forever. 

- Having to wait for something makes it feel that much better when you actually get it. 

- Everyone is on their own timeline in life. Just because your friend has reached a certain stage or milestone in their life doesn't mean that you have to be there too. 

- Hindsight is always 20/20, don't let looking back at something give you regret. Appreciate the moment and experience that it was at the time and be grateful for it. 

- Time does heal wounds, but there is no telling how long it will take to heal and those wounds might still leave scars. 

- The right person will make you feel tingly with butterflies, but in a comfortable exciting way. They won't make you feel anxious. 

- Music is can be so intertwined with your emotions. Music can verbalize the words that you can't quite express yourself. Songs can take you back to specific moments, feelings, and experiences. 

- Without the lows in life, the highs wouldn't feel so good. 

- Just one sentence or event can completely change your life, and sometimes there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. You have to acknowledge the situation, process your emotions, and readjust to your new reality. This doesn't mean you can't hope for the old normal to return, but don't let that hope keep you from discovering new ways to find happiness. 

- Don't bottle up your emotions. Find a way to express what you're feeling, whether that be talking to friends, crying, yelling, exercising, writing, or any other way that works for you. 

Of course this isn't an exhaustive list and I'm sure that there's things that I've forgotten, but that's what happens when I decide to write this all in one day without any planning. I wish I could go more in-depth with each of these, but unfortunately	I don't think I have the time or words that I want to use to do so. Regardless, I hope that maybe one or more of these things can be beneficial to at least one person who reads them (if anyone actually does). If you're a friend who reads this, say hi! If you're one of my students, what's up Mang Gang member! If you're someone else, hello, nice to meet you! Anywho, best wishes in this new year! May it be the best one yet :)

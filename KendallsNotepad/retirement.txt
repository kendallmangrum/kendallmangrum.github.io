I just received a letter saying that I didn't make a plan election within the 60 days following my hire date, and that I was defaulted into the TRF Hybrid Plan. However, I did make a plan election for the TRF MyChoice Plan on October 20th at approximately 5:30pm, which was before my election deadline. I selected the radio button on the website for the TRF MyChoice Plan and then submitted my choice, which was followed by a screen saying that my choice of the TRF MyChoice Plan had been confirmed. Both of my parents were present when I completed my plan election and saw the confirmation message as well. I need to get this changed so that I am enrolled in the TRF MyChoice Plan because that is what I selected within the given timeframe. Your records are false that I did not make a plan election, so I should not have been defaulted into the TRF Hybrid Plan. I followed the instructions that were mailed to me and the steps required to make a plan election on the website within the allotted time period, and should not be punished for any website failures that are out of my control.

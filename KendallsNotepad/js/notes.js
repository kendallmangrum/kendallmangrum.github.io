        content: `Hello there! If you are reading this currently, that means that I finally took some time and "completed" at least a decent portion of this website
        so that I am comfortable with people seeing it. Since I don't know who all might find this page, let me introduce myself a little. My name is Kendall Mangrum, 
        I am from Shelby County, and I am a graduate of Indiana Univesrity with a BS in Informatics and minors in Computer Science and Public Health. I am sure you are 
        asking yourself what this website is, why I created it, and what it all it might entail. If I'm being honest, I could ask myself those questions as well. Ultimately
        I would say that I created this website as a way for me to get out some of my thoughts. If you know me at all, you most likely know that I am a somewhat quiet person,
        but that doesn't mean that I don't have things that I want to say. If any of you follow me on Twitter, I'm sure you have seen my tweets where I shared something that 
        I had written. While kinda cringy and emotional, I really enjoyed sharing those writings and wanted to do something similar but without having to tweet my thoughts. 
        So, I am going to use this website that I created myself to share any of my thoughts, writings, opinions, advice, etc. that I want without having people get notified
        when I do so (I know at least one of my friends has tweet notifications on for me). One thing that I hope to make regular posts about are new songs that are released
        that I really enjoy. I always love when people share good music, so I hope that I can provide some good suggestions for you. Other than that, I'm not sure what all I 
        might include here; only time will tell. Anyways, thanks for taking some time out of your day to read this post and check out my site! If you have any suggestions on
        things for me to write about, let me know!`,

        preview: 'Here are some songs that I have been listening to on repeat that were released in August and September!',
        content: `August and September have been some great months in terms of new music. We received new albums from the likes of Blackbear, Kanye, Drake, Lil Nas X, and several
        other big name artists. For this edition of my notepad I am going to mention songs from each of these artists (besides Drake) that I find myself really enjoying currently.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first song that I want to mention is <i>ghost town</i> by Blackbear feat. Sasha Alex Sloan from his album/ep <i>Misery Lake</i>. I have to say that I am a big Blackbear fan and enjoy several of Sasha Sloan's songs, and
        this combination of the two doesn't disappoint. Sasha on the chorus is so catchy and Blackbear delivers his typical style of talking about the pain and lack of love that he is 
        receiving from his significant other. If you like Blackbear's typical sound than this song will fit right in.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next song that I have been constantly listening to is <i>New Again</i> by Kanye West off of his new album <i>Donda</i>. While I don't necessarily believe that this is the best song off of the album, the 
        beginning of the song just puts me in a good mood. Kanye starts the song by saying "If I hit you with a wyd, you better not hit me with a hey. It better be like hiiiiii with a bunch of i's or
        heyyyy with a bunch of y's." Hearing the way Kanye says this as well as the upbeat beat to the song really makes for an uplifting feeling. It also gives off positive vibes because of the church 
        choir that is used throughout the song. If you want to hear an upbeat encouraging song by one of the greatest music producers, check this one out.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the most recently released songs that I really enjoy is <i>LOST IN THE CITADEL</i> by Lil Nas X from his debut album <i>MONTERO</i>. This song is one of the more light songs on the album
        as it makes use of more simplistic drum and eletric guitar sounds. It is also a song that showcases Lil Nas X's voice from a singing perspective. The song has some emotion to it with the lyrics 
        being somewhat sad while the music has a more positive tone to it. For those who don't like explicit music, this song is completely family friendly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        *BONUS SONG*
        <br>
        There is one more song that I have to mention because it is actually the song that I have listened to the most. Some of you might not be familiar with the artist because he is rather new in the scene,
        but if you spend any time on YouTube, Twitter, or Twitch there is a good chance you've heard of him. I'm talking about CORPSE of course. His newest song <i>HOT DEMON B!TCHES NEAR U!!!</i> with Night Lovell
        is one that I have played back to back to back on numerous occassions since it was released. The smooth voice of Night Lovell, the hard hitting beat, one-liner verses, and simple chorus by CORPSE just gets 
        me to nod my head and get pumped up a bit. It also follows the trick of being a short song so that you have to replay the song to make you feel like you got your full fill. As you could infer from the title
        this song is not family friendly for several reasons, but as the kids say nowadays "this song slaps".

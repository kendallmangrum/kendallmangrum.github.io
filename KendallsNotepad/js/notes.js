        content: `Hello there! If you are reading this currently, that means that I finally took some time and "completed" at least a decent portion of this website
        so that I am comfortable with people seeing it. Since I don't know who all might find this page, let me introduce myself a little. My name is Kendall Mangrum, 
        I am from Shelby County, and I am a graduate of Indiana Univesrity with a BS in Informatics and minors in Computer Science and Public Health. I am sure you are 
        asking yourself what this website is, why I created it, and what it all it might entail. If I'm being honest, I could ask myself those questions as well. Ultimately
        I would say that I created this website as a way for me to get out some of my thoughts. If you know me at all, you most likely know that I am a somewhat quiet person,
        but that doesn't mean that I don't have things that I want to say. If any of you follow me on Twitter, I'm sure you have seen my tweets where I shared something that 
        I had written. While kinda cringy and emotional, I really enjoyed sharing those writings and wanted to do something similar but without having to tweet my thoughts. 
        So, I am going to use this website that I created myself to share any of my thoughts, writings, opinions, advice, etc. that I want without having people get notified
        when I do so (I know at least one of my friends has tweet notifications on for me). One thing that I hope to make regular posts about are new songs that are released
        that I really enjoy. I always love when people share good music, so I hope that I can provide some good suggestions for you. Other than that, I'm not sure what all I 
        might include here; only time will tell. Anyways, thanks for taking some time out of your day to read this post and check out my site! If you have any suggestions on
        things for me to write about, let me know!`,

        preview: 'Here are some songs that I have been listening to on repeat that were released in August and September!',
        content: `August and September have been some great months in terms of new music. We received new albums from the likes of Blackbear, Kanye, Drake, Lil Nas X, and several
        other big name artists. For this edition of my notepad I am going to mention songs from each of these artists (besides Drake) that I find myself really enjoying currently.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first song that I want to mention is <i>ghost town</i> by Blackbear feat. Sasha Alex Sloan from his album/ep <i>Misery Lake</i>. I have to say that I am a big Blackbear fan and enjoy several of Sasha Sloan's songs, and
        this combination of the two doesn't disappoint. Sasha on the chorus is so catchy and Blackbear delivers his typical style of talking about the pain and lack of love that he is 
        receiving from his significant other. If you like Blackbear's typical sound than this song will fit right in.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next song that I have been constantly listening to is <i>New Again</i> by Kanye West off of his new album <i>Donda</i>. While I don't necessarily believe that this is the best song off of the album, the 
        beginning of the song just puts me in a good mood. Kanye starts the song by saying "If I hit you with a wyd, you better not hit me with a hey. It better be like hiiiiii with a bunch of i's or
        heyyyy with a bunch of y's." Hearing the way Kanye says this as well as the upbeat beat to the song really makes for an uplifting feeling. It also gives off positive vibes because of the church 
        choir that is used throughout the song. If you want to hear an upbeat encouraging song by one of the greatest music producers, check this one out.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the most recently released songs that I really enjoy is <i>LOST IN THE CITADEL</i> by Lil Nas X from his debut album <i>MONTERO</i>. This song is one of the more light songs on the album
        as it makes use of more simplistic drum and eletric guitar sounds. It is also a song that showcases Lil Nas X's voice from a singing perspective. The song has some emotion to it with the lyrics 
        being somewhat sad while the music has a more positive tone to it. For those who don't like explicit music, this song is completely family friendly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        *BONUS SONG*
        <br>
        There is one more song that I have to mention because it is actually the song that I have listened to the most. Some of you might not be familiar with the artist because he is rather new in the scene,
        but if you spend any time on YouTube, Twitter, or Twitch there is a good chance you've heard of him. I'm talking about CORPSE of course. His newest song <i>HOT DEMON B!TCHES NEAR U!!!</i> with Night Lovell
        is one that I have played back to back to back on numerous occassions since it was released. The smooth voice of Night Lovell, the hard hitting beat, one-liner verses, and simple chorus by CORPSE just gets 
        me to nod my head and get pumped up a bit. It also follows the trick of being a short song so that you have to replay the song to make you feel like you got your full fill. As you could infer from the title
        this song is not family friendly for several reasons, but as the kids say nowadays "this song slaps".

        preview: 'Why you should give compliments and the impact they can have on someone!',
        content: `I wish people gave each other compliments more often. Compliments can completely change the trajectory of a person's day or even week, and I fully believe this to be true because it has done so 
        for me. These compliments aren't even usually anything to sophisticated. Most commonly they are about the outfit that I was wearing and that I "looked nice." Although this might not sound like anything
        that might really have an effect on a person's life, trust me it can and does. For example, this past week the weather got a lot cooler for a couple of days so I decided to wear a more fall oriented outfit to work.
        Since the beginning of summer, just about everday I had been wearing some form of shorts and a polo or T-shirt. However, with the cooler weather I decided to wear a long sleeve button up shirt and some 
        skinny khaki pants. On my way to the back of the store to clock in for the day one, of my coworkers told me that I looked nice. This compliment helped to set the tone of my day and more as I continue to 
        think about it. To further showcase the impact a simple compliment can have, I still remember one that I received from a girl my junior year of college, now a couple years ago. The girl was someone that I
        held office hours with and she complimented my purple flannel shirt that I had just gotten. I had already liked the shirt, but after that it became one of my favorites. Since then, the shirt has gotten a few
        more compliments and made my day on each occasion. Knowing the power of compliments, I have started to try and be someone that compliments others. Usually after doing so the person smiles and looks happy, but
        hopefully I am able to have just as big of an effect on them as others have on me. So please, be kind and try giving out some compliments to others. You never know how big an impact something so simple can 
        make in someone's life.

        preview: `Men aren't as emotionless as they can be made out to be.`,
        content: `After writing my 'note' about why people should give compliments more often, I wanted to further expand on the topic and discuss more about how compliments and other supportive actions can have such a 
        major impact on men. Typically, men tend to try and portray themselves as being tough and not as effected by the words, thoughts, or actions of others. This isn't actually the case for a good proportion of males. 
        Not to excuse the behavior, but it is reasonable to believe that men displays themselves in this way because of the expectations that society have created for them. Men are supposed to be strong, tough, reasonable,
        level-headed, and not be overwhelmed with emotions. These expectations I think have hurt men and their mental/emotional health as they don't always know how to properly manage or express their emotions, or 
        how to receive support from others. Recently when I was taking my break at work, one of my coworkers asked me if I was okay because they and some of the other workers had noticed that I was acting a little 
        differently than normal. Admittedly, at the time I was a little frustrated, but I told the coworker I was fine, not wanting to make a little frustration a big deal. Being asked if I was okay completely changed
        my mood for the rest of my shift however, because I realized that my coworkers cared about me. It was a nice changed to be asked how I was doing, rather than being the person trying to provide support. 
        <br><br>
        Now, I just want to get some thoughts out of my head that I have been wanting to for a while but hadn't yet. While these things might be common knowledge to some, I want people to hear this coming directly from
        a guy himself. 
        <br>
        <br>
        &emsp; 1. If you compliment a guy, it is almost guaranteed that he is going to remember what you said for <i>years</i>. One of my friends and I often find overselves talking about this happening and will both recall
        what someone said years ago because at the time it caught us off guard and totally made our day.
        <br><br>
        &emsp; 2. Guys seek validation and approval. We want to hear someone tell us that we are doing a good job, that someone is thankful for us, that we are appreciated. Otherwise, we begin to feel like we are failing or 
        not doing enough. 
        <br><br>
        &emsp; 3. Guys aren't always used to people being really kind to them, so sometimes the kindness is mistaken for interest. If you think that a guy is experiencing this, please just let them know so that it saves
        both sides from any further misunderstanding and/or awkwardness.
        
        <br><br>
        
        I kind of feel like I've been rambling a bit here, but I have just been wanting to get some of these things off of my mind for a while now. I could propbably go into more detail, but I'll save us both from that.
        Anyways, thanks for 'listening' to me, if anyone actually finds and reads these things...`,

        preview: `Is fate so strong, or is effort required as well?`,
        content: `I have struggled with the idea that 'if it's meant to be, it will be' for quite a while now. People apply this way of thinking to numerous aspects of their lives, whether it
        be them being selected for a new job, a certain event happening, or getting into a relationship. I tend to usually hear people use this saying when it is about them getting a job or 
        into a relationship. However, I find issues with this way of thinking because it just seems too passive. There has to be a little bit more effort in acheiving something like a new
        career path or a successful relationship. For example, I can talk to a girl regularly whether it be via text or in person, and more than likely the relationship isn't going to get
        any more serious than that unless I do something more. If I want the relationship to go any further, I have to let the girl know how I feel and what I'm thinking, otherwise she might
        just see the two of us as being good friends and me being someone she can talk to about anything. So while I see why believing 'if it's meant to be, it will be' can be tempting,
        I think it is a more relaxed way to live; a way not to get your hopes too high. I think that a much more powerful way to live is to put effort into whatever it is you want to achieve.
        If you want to get a new job, spend your time preparing yourself for the responsibilities that the job will require. If you want a successful serious relationship, you need to be open
        with your significant other, let them know what you are thinking and how you are feeling, communicate with them, and provide them with the things that they need in order for the relationship
        to be successful. Then if things don't work out, you know that you gave it your all, and things must not have been 'meant to be'. `,

                        In her eyes the galaxies were kept.<br>
                        Whenever I looked into them I saw the twinkling of countless stars.<br>
                        I often got lost in her eyes; their beauty so alluring.<br>
                        <br>
                        Her hair could be seen styled as the waves of the ocean,<br>
                        Flowing gently from her head to just below the shoulders.<br>

                        <br>
                        Her soul was as free as the wind;<br>
                        Nothing could contain her.<br>
                        Her presence, or lack thereof, could always be felt.<br>

                        Her personality radiated from her like the sun.<br>

                        <br>
                        She meant the world to me. <br>

                        But just as the tide comes and goes,<br>
                        So did she, and now I'm left without a world to call my own.<br>

                        <br>
                        But you're still figuring things out.<br>
                        A relationship with me at the time had you filled with doubt.<br>
                        <br>
                        I know I still have flaws but that's okay.<br>
                        I'll eventually be with someone, today's just not that day.<br>
                        <br>
                        And who knows, maybe someday everything will come full circle,<br>

        content: `1. I was a 10 year 4-H member. During my 4-H tenure, there were three main projects that I participated in. When I first started, I did Foods, Photography, and Scrapbooking. I did photography for only a few years because the last year I did it the judge said that they only way for me to score better was to get a better camera. I stopped doing scrapbooking around the same time because it took up such a large amount of time to complete and perfect. I participated in the foods project all 10 years and did quite well in it. 
                <br>
                2. I was the president for my class in high school. In order to be class president, all those wanting the position had to give a speech in front of the class. There were four of us who ran, and each of us would have been great choices for the position. I was able to acquire a slightly larger amount of votes than the other three, so I was elected to the position.
                <br>
                3. My right thumb is slightly shorter than my left one. This is due to me breaking my thumb at a soccer practice in eighth grade. At this specific practice we had gotten new balls to play with, so they were rather sticky to dribble. My cleat got stuck to the ball and I fell hard, my thumb landing in a hole. When I got up and looked, my thumb was a bit crooked. I held up my hand to show the coach and he thought I was doing a thumbs up to signal that I was fine. He was rather shocked with I walked up to him and he saw what had happened. 
                <br>
                4. I took swim lessons for several years at the Shelbyville pool. I feel like mentioning this as a fun fact because I did so well at the swim lessons that I got to skip level 3 and go to level 4, which was focused on learning each of the different stroke styles and was swam in the deep end. At one of the lessons, we were supposed to tread water for at least five minutes. I was so young and not quite strong enough that I started to sink, which felt like I was drowning at the time. I ended up having to repeat the level because I wasn't a strong enough swimmer yet. 
                <br>
                5. I played soccer for 12 years. I started playing rec soccer when I was in first grade through the Blue River Soccer Association in Shelbyville. I played rec soccer for several years before I eventually tried out for their travel soccer team around fourth or fifth grade. I ended up making the team and started out playing on defense even though I was used to playing forward or midfield during my time in rec. I quickly got moved back to midfield thanks to my speed and stamina. I played travel soccer for Blue River through my freshman year of high school, making some great friends and while being part of a very successful team. The Blue River team ended up splitting ways, so I joined the Columbus Express soccer team my sophomore year of high school, which ended up being my last season of travel. I also played junior high and high school soccer for my high school Southwestern, where our teams were also pretty successful. My senior year we finally got past our dreaded foes Greenwood Christian to win our Sectional on our home field. That was one of the best feelings I got to experience and something I won't soon forget. `,

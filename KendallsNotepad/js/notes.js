        content: `Hello there! If you are reading this currently, that means that I finally took some time and "completed" at least a decent portion of this website
        so that I am comfortable with people seeing it. Since I don't know who all might find this page, let me introduce myself a little. My name is Kendall Mangrum, 
        I am from Shelby County, and I am a graduate of Indiana Univesrity with a BS in Informatics and minors in Computer Science and Public Health. I am sure you are 
        asking yourself what this website is, why I created it, and what it all it might entail. If I'm being honest, I could ask myself those questions as well. Ultimately
        I would say that I created this website as a way for me to get out some of my thoughts. If you know me at all, you most likely know that I am a somewhat quiet person,
        but that doesn't mean that I don't have things that I want to say. If any of you follow me on Twitter, I'm sure you have seen my tweets where I shared something that 
        I had written. While kinda cringy and emotional, I really enjoyed sharing those writings and wanted to do something similar but without having to tweet my thoughts. 
        So, I am going to use this website that I created myself to share any of my thoughts, writings, opinions, advice, etc. that I want without having people get notified
        when I do so (I know at least one of my friends has tweet notifications on for me). One thing that I hope to make regular posts about are new songs that are released
        that I really enjoy. I always love when people share good music, so I hope that I can provide some good suggestions for you. Other than that, I'm not sure what all I 
        might include here; only time will tell. Anyways, thanks for taking some time out of your day to read this post and check out my site! If you have any suggestions on
        things for me to write about, let me know!`,
